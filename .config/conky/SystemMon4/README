Thank you for checking out my conky system monitoring widget version 0.1 - beta. Im still somewhat new to coding conky widgets so i hope you find this usefull and ofcourse feel free to build on it to make it better!!

You should unzip the SystemMon folder into your .conky folder which is found in your /home/username/ location or /root/.conky. I highly suggest using conky-manager 2 to run this and all conky widgets. It makes life so much easier in conky-verse!! Ive included a bash start-up & installation script if youd like to use it.
